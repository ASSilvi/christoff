Work locations vary from year to year but mostly we operate in and around Kelowna, Lumby, Salmon
Arm, Kamloops and Revelstoke.

We provide a mix of camp and motel accommodation depending on contracts. Our camps are
conveniently situated close to towns and have cell coverage and easy access to the outside world. The
beaches and swimming of Shuswap Lake are often just a short walk away. Delicious home cooked meals
and a fun, comfortable atmosphere enable our employees to maximize their earnings. Motels, when
used, are provided at no cost.

Prices and terrain vary with each contract but in general our ground is in the mid-to-upper range of the
difficulty scale. Tree prices are 16c+, but average typically in the 22-24c range.

All-Stars Silviculture is a member of the Western Forestry Contractors Association and is SAFE Certified.
We financially support local charities including BC Children’s Hospital, Kelowna Women’s Shelter, and
Doctors Without Borders
