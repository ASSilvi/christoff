Work locations vary from year to year but mostly we operate in and around Kelowna, Lumby, Salmon
Arm, Kamloops and Revelstoke.

We provide a mix of camp and motel accommodation depending on contracts. Our camps are
conveniently situated close to towns and have cell coverage and easy access to the outside world. The
beaches and swimming of Shuswap Lake are often just a short walk away. Delicious home cooked meals
and a fun, comfortable atmosphere enable our employees to maximize their earnings. Motels, when
used, are provided at no cost.

Prices and terrain vary with each contract but our minimum base price is 16c/tree and our average is approximately 23c/tree.

All-Stars Silviculture Ltd is based in Enderby, BC, has been in business since 2005 and has planted over 15 million seedlings in that time.
